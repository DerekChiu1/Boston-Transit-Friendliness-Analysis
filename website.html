    <h1>Mapping Transit Friendliness in Boston Neighborhoods</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Walkability and accessible infrastructure are key factors in the quality of life for urban residents. Boston, ranked 4th in the nation for public transit usage, presents a compelling case for understanding the spatial distribution of sidewalks, bike paths, and subway lines. This project introduces a Transit Friendliness Index (TFI) to evaluate and visualize the accessibility of different neighborhoods in Boston.

  <!-- METHODOLOGY -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Our dataset sources include GeoJSON and shapefiles from <a href="https://data.boston.gov">Data.Boston.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-mbta-rapid-transit">MassGIS</a>. Using Python with GeoPandas, we aligned coordinate systems, cleaned invalid geometries, and calculated densities and lengths of infrastructure per neighborhood. These metrics were then synthesized into a custom Transit Friendliness Index (TFI), accounting for sidewalk coverage, bike path density, and subway proximity.

  <!-- VISUALIZATION 1 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Sidewalk and Bike Path Densities by Neighborhood</h2>
      This bar chart shows that dense, central neighborhoods like the Leather District and Bay Village have the highest sidewalk densities, while outer areas like Hyde Park and East Boston have significantly lower infrastructure coverage. Bike path density is low overall and unevenly distributed, highlighting gaps in cycling support across Boston.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Neighborhood Area vs. Transit Friendliness Index</h2>
    <p>
      This scatter plot compares each neighborhood's physical area to its overall TFI score. The trend suggests smaller, denser areas often rank higher in walkability, potentially due to more compact and accessible layouts.

    <h2>Interactive Map: Sidewalk and Bike Path Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      This map provides a structural overview of Boston’s sidewalk and bike path networks. Toggle layers on or off to explore where infrastructure is concentrated and where gaps might exist. The interactive functionality helps identify priorities for transit-oriented development.

    <h2>Transit Friendliness Index by Neighborhood</h2>
    <p>
      This lollipop chart ranks Boston’s neighborhoods by their Transit Friendliness Index score. Use the slider to filter neighborhoods within specific score ranges and highlight outliers with particularly high or low accessibility.

  <!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Compact neighborhoods like the North End and Back Bay tend to score highest on the Transit Friendliness Index.</li>
      <li>Peripheral neighborhoods often have lower sidewalk and bike path coverage, indicating potential targets for infrastructure investment.</li>
      <li>Overlaying sidewalk, bike, and subway access helps visualize gaps and prioritize equity-focused transit planning.</li>
    </ul>
