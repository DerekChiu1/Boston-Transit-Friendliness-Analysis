# Boston Neighborhood Transit Friendliness Analysis
## Project Description
This project analyzes the friendliness of transit options of sidewalks and bike paths across all 23 Boston neighborhoods, in which the transit friendliness is measured by a score calculated based on the density of sidewalks and bikepaths for each area. A website is built as the final product that includes interactive maps showing the distribution of sidewalks and bike paths, as well as the transit friendliness score for each neighborhood. The interactive nature of plots enable users to freely zoom in/out, hover, and click the graphs to gain insights. Static visualizations like scatter plots and bar charts are also included to show the density of sidewalks and bike paths, and the relationship between neighborhood areas and the friendliness score. The goal is to help users understand the distribution and frienliness of sidewalks and bikepaths in Boston, as well as to compare whether there's unequal resource or access to these transit facilities between urban and rural neighborhoods.

## How to Install and Run the Website
### Dependencies:
  - matplotlib >= 3.9.2
  - geopandas >= 1.0.1
  - altair >= 5.0.1
  - pandas >= 2.2.2
  - numpy >= 1.26.4
  - folium >= 0.19.5
  - scikit-learn >= 1.6.1
  - D3.js >= version 7

### Instructions:
  1. Make sure all libraries in the above dependency list are installed to your current working environment
  2. Download the Visualizations.iypng file and all data files from the data folder
  3. Run the Visualizations.iypng file to get four of the five plots, including 2 maps, 1 bar chart, and 1 lollipop chart. Then, download the charts into the Plots folder (html extension for interactive plots, png for static plots)
  4. Download and run the index.html, website.css, and website.js files, which should create the last plot and website itself. By running index.html on live server, the website will launch on the browser

### Troubleshooting:
  - If there's error reading the data files, make sure they're in the Data folder and their names aren't modified after downloaded
  - If there's error with the libraries used, make sure they're all properly installed to your current environment, and the version are the same or newer than the versions in the dependency list
  - If there's error running the website, make sure live server is properly installed and your internet connection is stable and reliable
